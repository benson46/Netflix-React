# 🎬 Netflix Clone using React

A sleek **Netflix-inspired web app** built using **React**, developed during my React learning journey.  
It replicates the classic **Netflix homepage**, showcasing trending movies and shows using **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**.

> ⚠️ This is a **frontend-only** clone. Video playback is not available — the app fetches and displays movie posters and data using the API.

- **Frontend:** React, JSX, CSS
- **API:** [TMDb (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
